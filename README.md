# Lore

# Details
	A city building game inspired by role playing games like Dungeons and Dragons.  This is a work in progress so opening it in Unity will provide limited playability and
only a few buildings and NPCs to choose from.  Many of the basic functions are in here, albeit there may be room for optimization.

# Future plans:
	- The next thing to come will be removing adventurers on a quest from those you have recruited, as well as a way to check who you have recruited.
	- Then, the Lore function (hook) of the game.  

# Using Lore API with this:
	- If you'd like to use LoreAPI with this you just need to change the data in the Database file.  Change the filepath to wherever LoreAPI saves its data(usually the project folder)
	- If you download this version though it will come with a database of 18 NPCs (mostly with junk/test data), but you'll be able to see how the Database script handles the .db file.
